# Kafka Streams Learning Repository

Welcome to the Kafka Streams Learning Repository! This repository is designed to help you learn about Kafka Streams, a powerful library for building real-time applications and microservices.

## Introduction

Kafka Streams is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. It provides built-in support for parallelism, fault tolerance, and state management, making it an ideal choice for processing streams of data.

## Getting Started

To get started with Kafka Streams, make sure you have Kafka installed on your local machine or have access to a Kafka cluster. You can download Kafka from the [official website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later
- Apache Kafka installed and running

### Setting up a Maven Project

We will use a Kafka Streams Maven Archetype for creating a Streams project structure. Run the following commands:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.kafka \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=streams-quickstart-java \
    -DarchetypeVersion=3.7.0 \
    -DgroupId=streams.examples \
    -DartifactId=streams-quickstart \
    -Dversion=0.1 \
    -Dpackage=myapps
```

You can use different values for `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `package` parameters if you like.

## Project Structure

This repository contains example projects and exercises to help you understand Kafka Streams concepts. Here's the structure of the repository:

- `examples/`: Contains example Kafka Streams applications covering various use cases.
- `exercises/`: Provides exercises and challenges for hands-on learning.
